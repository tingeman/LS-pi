Using rsync to transfer files from IOT to Terrameter
====================================================

rsync must be run from IOT, as the Terrameter user does
not have permission to access all directories on the IOT.

rsync -n -aic ./ root@192.168.23.10:/home/root/


NB: rsync is one-way sync only! The above will overwrite
    changed files on remote by files from local.
	If you want to sync from Terrameter to IOT, use:
    
	rsync -n -aic root@192.168.23.10:/home/root/ ./ 


-n     dry-run - does not change any files
-a     archive mode
-i     itemize changes - show a list of what is being done
-c     use checksum to determine changes


Run first with the -n parameter
Check all suggested changes, to see if files are sent that should not be.
E.g. we don't want log-files to be overwritten on the Terrameter.
When you are sure only good files are transferred, 
run the command without the -n flag.



Example output:

.d..tp..... ./
.f..tp..... CHECKIFREBOOTED
.f..tp..... ECR_settings.sql
<f+++++++++ ECR_settings_1mA.sql
<f+++++++++ ECR_settings_5mA.sql
.f..tp..... GET_VOLTAGE.sql
.f..tp..... GO
